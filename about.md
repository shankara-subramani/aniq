Hey there, my name is Sonaal Bangera and I’m a Designer who loves crafting solutions for the web and especially mobile. I grew up in Mumbai and currently based in Chennai, India. I co-founded a design and development studio called NFN Labs where we build beautiful / functional web and mobile apps. I also run Kabadiwalla Connect – where our aim is to work with the kabadiwalla ecosystem and find out ways to send less waste to India’s landfills
